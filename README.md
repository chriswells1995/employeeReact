# employeeReact


Initially formed from Pupster App, there is still some leftover code not being used that should be deleted. 
BUT, 
The current website does allow a user to look at a list of employees (randomly generated from an API),
the user can put input in the search bar to filter by name, phone number, email, or date of birth,
and the user can click on the "Sort by age" button, and see all the users sorted oldes to youngest.

Currently the alphabatize button still does not work,
and the table does not look as pretty as it should. These are future developments.
